# retrospective-aphasia-study

Aphasia is a language disorder caused by brain damage. Some people with aphasia have difficulties with naming items. For example, when presented with a picture of a :cat2:, they might say "dog". Another common error is answering "school" to a picture of a desk, and this is called an **associative error**. Associative errors are errors that can be associated to the target, like *hospital* :hospital: and *stethoscope* :stethoscope:,  but do NOT share the same category like *lion* :lion: and *tiger* :tiger:.  

This research tested two contrasting accounts regarding the occurrence of associative errors in naming in aphasia.

One account claims that associative errors are a symptom of cognitive control impairment, and the second that they are driven by itemsâ€™ properties (like the number of category neighbours). 

Data were analysed from 212 people with aphasia on picture naming and a semantic association task. Associative errors were classified in two ways:
- by manualy coding all errors
- by using an association corpus (if the target-error matched a cue-response it was considered an associative error)

Two analyses were performed:
- Analysis 1 tested whether production of associative errors was predicted by performance on a semantic association task as predicted by the first account: They were not. 

- Analysis 2 investigated whether two item properties (Category Cohort Size, Strength of Associates) predicted the occurrence of associative errors as predicted by the second account: They did.

Overall, these results support the account where, in picture naming in aphasia, item characteristics influence the nature of the semantic error produced, and associative errors in particular.
